# Project Odin Chat Application

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a full-stack chat application, which is one of the projects I am developing as part of my learning journey with Project Odin. The primary goal of this project is to solidify my understanding of building scalable, full-stack applications using modern technologies such as React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, I aim to learn and apply the following concepts:

- Building a RESTful API with Express.
- Managing user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Creating a responsive and interactive front-end with React.
- Implementing real-time communication with WebSocket (planned for future development).
- Structuring a full-stack application with best practices for scalability and maintainability.

## Technologies

- **Front-end**: React, React Router, Axios
- **Back-end**: Node.js, Express, Mongoose
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT

## Features

- User registration and login system.
- Option to send and receive messages in real-time.
- Scalable folder structure for easy management and expansion.
- Image upload capability for messages (planned for future development).
